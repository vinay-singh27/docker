Basic Docker Concepts & Commands:
1. When referring to docker, we usually refer to the complete docker ecosystem. These are:
	a. Docker Client(CLI)
	b. Docker Server
	c. Docker Machine
	d. Docker Images
	e. Docker Hub
	f. Docher Compose

2. Docker is used to create or run containers
3. Container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application
	- It uses Linux Namespacing & Control Group
	- Namespacing is used to isolate the resources
	- Control Group is used to limit the amount of resource used by a process

4. Images usually contains File System Snapshots and Start Command
5. Since Windows and Mac does not support Namespacing, docker usually run on Linux VM installed on the Windows/Mac OS

Docker Commands:
1. docker run image_name
	a. docker run = docker create + docker start 
2. docker create image_name = gives the name of the container
3. docker start -a container_id
4. docker ps = gives the list of all the active containers
5. docker ps -all = gives the list of all containers
6. docker system prune - delete all containers along with the cache images
7. docker stop 
	- send the SIGTERM command and thus gives few seconds to the process to close
8. docker kill = immediately stops the process
9. docker exec -it container_id {command}
	- it refers to input and output
	- command can be sh to access the container's shell
