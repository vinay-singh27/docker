Build an Image:
1. Create a Dockerfile inside the directory
2. Inside the directory, run docker build .
    - To get the image id, use DOCKER_BUILDKIT = 0

Except the first step, to run the other steps, docker creates an intermediate container

To run the RUN command, 
- It creates an intermediate container using the base image
- Inside this intermediate container, we run the second command line 
- It downloaded and create a folder for redis 
- Once completed, we stop the container. We take a Filesystem snapshot and create a temporary image

Tagging the Image :
docker build -t vinaysin/redis:latest

Port Forwarding
- Though container can access outside info, we need to create mapping to allow outside traffic inside container
- This is a runtime operation 

docker run -p 8080:8080 image_name

-p from port : to port
